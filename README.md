notebook 06 - selections
Using the cars data, create a scatter-plot where the size of the points becomes larger as you hover over them.

Using the cars data, create a two-panel histogram (say, miles per gallon counts in one panel, horsepower counts in the other) where you can drag your mouse to select data in the left panel to filter the data in the second panel.

Change the above scatter-plus-histogram example we did above so that you can pan and zoom on the scatterplot the histogram only reflects points that are visible at the given moment
